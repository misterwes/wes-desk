I'm a data journalist, an old home owner (the homes are old…well, I mean I am too, but I was referring to the house we live in), a husband, and a dad. I work from home and I like it that way. I dream of being a novelist and a screenwriter, but I am tired a lot so dream is all I ever seem to do. 

Does this suck? This sucks….
